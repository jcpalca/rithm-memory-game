# rithm-memory-game

A memory game where you can choose to generate 2-16 (only even numbers) cards of paired random colors to match.

The game with the least amount of guesses gets saved to local storage, and can be cleared in game.

After winning, the player can choose to play again with the same pairs of randomly colored cards, or go back to choose the number of cards they want to generate, which will then generate newly colored cards.
